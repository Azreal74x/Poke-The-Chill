Thank you for playing Poke The Chill!<br>

The game was made for our web games class, where we had to create a clicker game using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.<br>

This game was made by:<br>
-Simona Kovacheva (artist)<br>
-Emily Murad (engineer)<br>
-Burak Enoz (engineer)<br>
-Ferhat Kelten (engineer)<br>

Some fun facts:<br>
-Moni coins are named after our artist Simona, the chill girl that drops these coins is her. The coins are used for power ups called Balkan anger and Communist gain, because Simona is Bulgarian.<br>
-Chill guy with the axelot and with the hood are both our web games class teachers. They drop F grade coins when they lose their chill, these can be used for mouse skins.<br>
-There are some Turkish characters which are references to our two engineers Burak and Ferhat who are Turkish.<br>
-The characters animation speeds up allowing them to bob their heads to the beat of the timed events.<br>
-There are 12 different characters spread over 6 tiers.
